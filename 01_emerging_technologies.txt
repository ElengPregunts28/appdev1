Exploring Emerging Technologies

~ Cloud Computing ~

Purpose: Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the 
Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining
physical data centers and servers, users can access technology services such as
computing power, storage, databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud 
provider like Amazon Web Services. The cloud computing offers customers 
greater flexibility and scalability compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure. 

Usage: Cloud computing in higher education has the power to process
complex workloads and store large amounts of data which helps researchers
to get more time to dedicate to research, speeding up innovation and time to
insights. Students and faculty can access digital resources through the cloud, 
which improves access to educational materials while reducing paper waste
and eliminates the need for expensive physical textbooks.

With cloud computing, businesses can recover quickly from disasters and
maintain operations with minimal disruption. Cloud storage solutions 
offer redundancy and data replication, reducing the risk of data loss due
to hardware failures or other issues. By storing data across multiple servers
and locations, cloud providers ensure that information remains accessible
even if one server fails. 

Example: 
Netflix relies on cloud-computing services to run its video-streaming service
and it other business systems, too.

~ Machine Learning ~

Purpose: Machine Learning encompasses a comprehensive array of learning
and training tools powered by self-improving deep learning algorithms that
can process big data, identify key metrics, recurring patterns, and relations 
among variables, and therefore understand how such factors influence the
core trends and scenarios in this sector. 

Usage: Machine Learning-based predictive data analytics helps cater to the
unique needs of every student. This technology has been implemented into
several eLearning software solutions to monitor various parameters such
as exercise completion time, time spent on the platform, number of logins,
and test results, and assess student performance, engagement, and learning 
patterns, or even forecast learning outcomes. 

When machine learning algorithms are fed a steady stream of real-time data,
they can quickly detect bottlenecks, anomalies, and other operational inefficiencies. 
Organizations can use this information to figure out how to automate repetitive
tasks and streamline recurring work processes. 

Example: A logistics company can use machine learning to analyze real-time
streaming data to determine the best routes and better predict demand, which
can then help them maintain optimal staffing levels to reduce costs and 
maximize margins.

~ Artificial Intelligence ~

Purpose: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers
and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving,
decision making, creativity, and autonomy. Applications and devices equipped
with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to
human language. They can learn new information and experience. and make
detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act independently,
replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention. 

Usage: AI help foster the skills students will need to navigate and shape the
future. Tools like ChatGPT can help promote students' critical thinking
when used in sophisticated ways for deeper, more engaged learning. It can
accelerate the long overdue transformation of education systems towards
inclusive learninig that will prepare young people to thrive and shape a 
better future. At the same time. teachers can use these technologies to 
enhance their teaching practice and professional experience. 

AI in cybersecurity can work with vast databases that most cybersecurity
companies maintain to check for virus attacks. The technology is also being
adopted by antivirus companies to provide a proactice method of combating
cyberattacks. 

Example: Out in the fields and in the AgTech world, farmers and scientist
are using AI to monitor crops, predict yields and keep pests at bay. AI-enabled
precision farming helps farmers make data-driven decisions so they can 
optimize irrigations, improve fertilization and reduce waste.

~ Blockchain ~

Purpose: Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the 
process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business networks.
It provides immediate, shared, and observable information that is stored
on an immutable ledger that only permissioned network members can access. 
A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and
more. And because members share a single view of the truth, users can see
all details of a transaction end to end, giving greater confidence, and new 
efficiencis and opportunities. 

Usage: Blockchain's immutable ledger technology creates a chronological
list of events that have transpired in real time. These academic records are
useful for verifying transcript, diplomas, and test scores. In addition, teachers,
university administrators, and students can use smart contracts to agree on
assignment due dates and even deploy student loan payments. 

Deemed as a "new weapon in cybersecurity," blockchain's decentralized, 
tamper-proof ledger comes with built-in defenses against theft, fraud, and
unauthorized users via cryptographic coding and consensus mechanisms. 
Because of this, blockchain has been adopted into cybersecurity arsenals to
maintain cryptocurrency, secure bank assets, protect patient health records,
fortify IoT devices and even safeguard military and defense data. 

Example: Parchment offers digital credential services to students, academic
institutions and employers. K-12 educators use the company's blockchain to
upload any important developmental progress while higher education institutions
use the platform to review academic merit, process applications and produce
immutable diplomas. Additionally, students have full-time access to all
educational information and can easily share academic achievements with
future employers.

~Gamification ~

Purpose: Gamification is a strategy that intergrates entertaining and immersive
gaming elements into nongame contexts to enhance engagement and motivate 
certain behaviors. Gamification uses game design and mechanics, such as badges,
leaderboards, points and rewards, to encourage active participation and
make tasks fun and enjoyable. The goal is to boost motivation, improve
material retention, and encourage active participation through immediate
feedback. 

Usage: In education, gamification is intended to transform traditional lessons
into a enhanced learning experience where students choose to explore and
practice content, earning badges and status benefits. Educators can increase
student engagement and satisfaction with gamification. By integrating common
gaming elements such as competition, challenges, and rewards, students are
motivated to learn and play an active role in their learning. 

Gamification has proven effective in enhancing workplae training and improving
employee engagement. 

Example: Companies such as Deloitte and IBM have used gamified training
programs to increase knowledge retention, encourage collaboration and motivate 
employees to complete training modules.
