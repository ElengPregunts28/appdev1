1. In circumstances like this, it is important to be empathetic and compassionate
while also being professional and keeping everyone focused on the major task at
hand: accomplishing work. Personal crises can greatly impact someone's ability to
focus and perform, so offering my key team member the flexibility to take the time 
they need would be a lot of help on their part. It's also significant to
reassess the tasks and redistribute the work between team members to ensure
that we stay on track as much as possible, focusing on the most critical
tasks that need to be completed by the deadline. I will also inform
the stakeholders about the situation without breaching confidentiality,
discussing the potential adjustments to the timelines and deliverables 
might be needed due to unforeseen circumstances. And,
I will bring in additional resources or temporary help to cover
the workload to support and acknowledge my team's effort.

2. I'd immediately inform my manager about the situation, clearly
explaining the urgency and the impact on my availability. And
I will reach out to colleagues for support in covering my workload.
I will also discuss potential adjustments to timelines and 
deliverables with my manager and stakeholders, to ensure that
they're aware of the situation and the proposed plan. I should also 
identify tasks that can be reassigned to team members, focusing
on the most urgent and high-priority taks. And if possible, I'd
work remotely or during off-hours to manage urgent tasks while
attending to family needs and catch up on missed work, ensuring
that any backlog is addressed promptly.

3. The manager and the developer can engage in scenario planning
exercises to anticipate various risk scenarios and develop action
plans. They should regularly review and update these scenarios
to stay prepared for unexpected events. Implementing a feedback
loop where after each project, the team reflects on what went 
well and what could be improved in terms of risk management.
